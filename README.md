## Design Implemented
<p I implemented my figma design from my Monday In-class Activity Webpage /p>
<img width="821" height="477" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a493b3a2-b5ae-476b-a60f-c683e932f794" />

## JavaScript Interactions

### Interaction 1: Holiday Popup
<p This interaction gives the user a popup when they first enter the website. This popup includes important changes to the fictional business hours of operation due to the holidays, and includes a close button for the user to close it and continue to viewing the website. /p>

### Interaction 2: Image Carousel
<p This interaction includes a photo carousel that automatically rotates the images for the user to view several photos about the business without the images taking up a lot of space by being displayed on the website all at once. /p>

### Interaction 3: Contact Form Prompt
<p This interaction is enabled when the user clicks the Adopt Us! button. It opens up a prompt for the user to enter their contact information so that the business can contact them with adoption information. /p>

## Challenges Faced
<p One challenge I faced was with getting a colored overlay on the background image in the Hero section; it was a lot more difficult for me to figure it out than I expected it to be.
Some other challenges I had was with the JavaScript. For the image carousel, I was having issues sizing the container and getting the images to fit without stretching them. I also had some syntax troubles when making the adoption contact info prompt, which I was able to solve using a JavaScript validator. /p>
