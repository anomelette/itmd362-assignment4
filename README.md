**Design Implemented**

I implemented my figma design from my Monday In-class Activity Webpage
<img width="1221" height="877" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a493b3a2-b5ae-476b-a60f-c683e932f794" />

**JavaScript Interactions**
Interaction 1: Holiday Popup
This interaction gives the user a popup when they first enter the website. This popup includes important changes to the fictional business's hours of operation due to the holidays, and includes a close button for the user to close it and continue to viewing the website.

Interaction 2: Image Carousel
This interaction includes a photo carousel that automatically rotates the images for the user to view several photos about the business without the images taking up a lot of space by being displayed on the website all at once.

Interaction 3: Contact Form Prompt
This interaction is enabled when the user clicks the "Adopt Us!" button. It opens up a prompt for the user to enter their contact information so that the business can contact them with adoption information.
